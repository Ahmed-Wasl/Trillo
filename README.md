# Trillo
A project about a website for booking, taken from a ([Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/) course for sass), you can see the project here [SandBox]([https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/trillo-qyrhdc](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/trillo-forked-tm4ywz))

## Version 1
I have finished following the instructor to build the foundation of the project, including (html structure, SASS formatting, and site responsiveness).
